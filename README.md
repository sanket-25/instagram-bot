# instagram-bot
Javascript Code basically to Follow and Unfollow upto 200 users in a single click (200 because exceeding this causes insta to temporarily disable your account).
That's how I gained upto 2000 Insta Followers 

Procedure =>

Open Instagram on your Web Browser -> Go to the followers/following list of any user you wish to follow his followers/following -> Right Click -> Inspect -> Console -> Copy Paste the code in the console -> Enter

 (sometimes browser doesn't allow the code to run in that case change your browser settings)*
 (also the following/unfollowing sequence becomes infinite loop due to unresponsive browser, in that case refresh the page to prevent following/unfollowing more than 200 users)*
