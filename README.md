# instagram-bot

So, this simple code works on the idea that you follow some number of users, later when they follow you back , unfollow them and all other. At the end of the day you land up with more followers than previous.

Javascript Code basically to Follow and Unfollow upto 200 users in a single click (200 because exceeding this causes insta to temporarily disable your account).

That's how I gained upto 2k Insta Followers ⚡


Procedure =>

Open Instagram on your Web Browser -> Go to the followers/following list of any user you wish to follow his followers/following -> Right Click -> Inspect -> Console -> Copy Paste the code in the console -> Enter


(sometimes browser doesn't allow the code to run in that case change your browser settings)*
 
(also the following/unfollowing sequence becomes infinite loop due to unresponsive browser, in that case refresh the page to prevent following/unfollowing more than 200 users)*
